# Real Time Bus Tracker 🚌
Mi first map creation and manipulation project. 

This project uses the Mapbox API, CSS, HTML and Javascript. 

## Description: 
This project provides a visual real-time tracking display of the [Bus Route #1 of Boston](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/1/line), running between Harvard and Nubian. 
Displays a colored set of markers showing all the buses running this route in real time.
Info can also be updated by pressing the button located on the top right corner, if needed.
